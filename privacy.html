    <ol start="3">
      <li>How We share the Information We Collect</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We may share customers' personal information with the following parties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Vendors who provide services on our behalf within the United States and

      <li>
        Additionally, when the information collected about you does not directly
        identify you, we may share this information with third parties.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may further disclose your information under the following
      circumstances:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>When required by law or legal process;</li>
      <li>
        When disclosing to law enforcement agencies or other governmental
        officials;
      </li>
      <li>
        When we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent
        physical harm, financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of
        suspected or actual fraud or illegal activities.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we reserve the right to transfer the personal information we
      hold about you in the event of a planned or completed sale or transfer of
      all or part of our business or assets (including in the contexts of
      reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation).
    </p>

    <ol start="4">
      <li>
        How do we protect and preserve the personal information we collect
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We have implemented a range of security procedures and measures aimed at
      preventing the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, improper disclosure,
      alteration, or destruction of information transmitted through our
      services. However, given the complexity of the internet environment, the
      security of data transmitted over the internet or stored on servers cannot
      be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. Therefore, although we are
      committed to protecting the security and privacy of your information, we
      cannot fully guarantee the absolute security of the information you
      disclose or transmit to us online, and we do not accept liability for any
      theft, damage, or accidental disclosure of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will retain
      your information or information related to you as necessary. Once this
      information no longer serves its original purpose, we will delete it or
      store it in a de-identified form, unless legal or regulatory requirements
      necessitate an extended retention period. In determining the retention
      period for information, we consider several factors, including but not
      limited to the type of products and services you request or obtain, the
      nature and duration of our relationship with you, the likelihood of you
      re-registering for our products or services, the impact of deleting
      specific information on the service experience, statutory retention
      requirements, and statutes of limitations for legal actions.
    </p>
    <ol start="5">
      <li>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Our services are not intended for minors under the age of 16. We strictly
      do not collect personal information from children under the age of 16
      without explicit consent from their parents or legal guardians. If you
      become aware that a child has provided us with personal information
      without sufficient parental authorization, please contact us immediately
      using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
      Once it is confirmed that personal information has been submitted by a
      child under the age of 16 without adequate parental consent, we will take
      necessary steps to ensure that such information is securely deleted.

      <li>Information Transferring</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Our services may be hosted and managed on servers located outside the
      country/region where you initially provided your information, including
      but not limited to the United States. Therefore, we may transfer your
      personal information to the United States and/or other countries/regions,
      where data protection regulations may differ from those in the
      country/region where you originally provided your information. When your
      personal information is located in these countries/regions, it may be
      subject to lawful access by local courts, law enforcement agencies, and
      national security authorities.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      If you are a non-U.S. resident or a resident of a country to which your
      information may be transferred, you should understand and agree that your
      personal information will be processed in the United States and/or such
      other countries/regions.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      In transferring your information, we will strictly follow the security
      measures and protection principles described in this Privacy Policy to
      ensure that your information is properly protected.

    <ol start="7">
      <li>Third-Party</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      To enhance the convenience of accessing information, our services may
      include links to third-party websites, applications, and services that are
      not directly affiliated with xxxxxxxxxx. Please be aware that these
      third-party entities may have their own privacy statements or policies. We
      strongly recommend that you read these carefully to understand their
      specific practices. We explicitly state that we are not responsible for
      the privacy practices of any websites, applications, or services not
      operated by our company.

    <ol start="8">
      <li>Change of control and Updates of Policy</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the event of a sale, acquisition, merger, corporate restructuring, or
      change in control, your information may be transferred to a third party.
      This means that if we decide to sell, merge, or transfer any part of our
      business, your personal information may be included as part of the
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, as we continuously introduce new features and services, and
      as the legal environment and industry privacy and security best practices
      evolve, we may make timely revisions to this Privacy Policy.
