<p><strong>4.How We Protect and Retain Collected Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>At Her Bible, we take the security of your personal information very seriously and are committed to implementing multiple layers of protection to ensure your data is safeguarded at the highest level. We protect and retain your personal information through the following measures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Encryption: All collected personal information is processed using advanced encryption technologies during transmission and storage, ensuring that your data cannot be accessed or tampered with by unauthorized individuals while being transmitted to our servers or stored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access Control: We implement strict access control measures, allowing only authorized employees or service providers to access your data when legally and necessary. We regularly review and update these permissions to ensure that only personnel involved in application operations and maintenance can access your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Minimization: We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services and ensure that this data is retained only for the necessary duration. Your personal information will be promptly deleted or anonymized once the purpose for collection is fulfilled, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure Storage: Your data is stored on secure servers that meet industry standards, equipped with multiple safeguards such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and physical security measures. We regularly conduct security reviews and vulnerability assessments to prevent potential security threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Sharing Restrictions: We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your sensitive personal information to third parties. We will only share your information with third parties if you explicitly authorize it or if it is necessary to provide essential services for the application (e.g., collaborating with payment processors). Even in these cases, partners must adhere to strict privacy and data protection requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Retention and Deletion: You can request the deletion of your account and associated personal information at any time. We will process your request promptly and ensure that all data is thoroughly deleted from our servers. We will only retain your data when legally required or necessary for legitimate business purposes, strictly following the legally mandated retention periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adopting these comprehensive protective measures, Her Bible ensures the security of your personal information, helping you use our services with peace of mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not collect personal information from children under 18 without obtaining explicit consent from their parents or legal guardians. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without sufficient parental authorization, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided at the end of this privacy policy. Once we confirm that a child has submitted personal information without adequate parental consent, we will take the necessary steps to ensure that the information is securely deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.Data Transmission</strong></p>
<p>At Her Bible, we place a high priority on the security of personal information during transmission. To ensure that your data is not stolen, intercepted, or tampered with while being transmitted between your device and our servers, we employ various technical measures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure Connection: When you use the Her Bible application, all data transmissions between you and the server are conducted through a secure connection. We strictly avoid transmitting any sensitive information over unencrypted connections to prevent the risk of data leakage during transmission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection Against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: We implement multiple security measures to ensure that your data cannot be intercepted or tampered with by malicious parties during transmission. We regularly update and maintain transmission protocols to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these data transmission security measures, Her Bible ensures that your personal data is consistently protected throughout the entire transmission process from your device to our servers, allowing you to use our services with confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the convenience of accessing information, our services may contain links to third-party websites, applications, and services that are not directly affiliated with Her Bible. Please note that these third-party entities may have their own privacy statements or policies. We strongly encourage you to read these statements carefully to understand their specific practices. We explicitly state that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites, applications, or services not operated by our company.</p>
